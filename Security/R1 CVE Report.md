### CVE-2024-20467
**Severity:** HIGH (CVSS Score: 8.6)

#### Description
A vulnerability in the implementation of the IPv4 fragmentation reassembly code in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.

#### Technical Details
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** None
- **User Interaction:** None
- **Scope:** Changed
- **Confidentiality Impact:** None
- **Integrity Impact:** None
- **Availability Impact:** High

#### Vulnerability Characteristics
- The vulnerability is due to improper management of resources during fragment reassembly
- Affects devices running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 17.12.1 or 17.12.1a
- Particularly impacts:
  - Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers
  - Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers

#### Attack Method
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by:
1. Sending specific sizes of fragmented packets to the affected device
