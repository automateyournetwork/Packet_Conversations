# Packet Capture Analysis - April 2024

## Summary
This report analyzes network traffic captured within a specific session between a local client and an external server. Insights gleaned from this PCAP are summarized below:

### General Insights
- The network communication predominantly involved protocol interactions over QUIC and UDP, allowing for fast, encrypted internet transactions, optimized typically for media streaming or resource fetches.

### IP Highlights
- **Source IP**: 192.168.2.61 (Private network IP)
- **Destination IP**: 142.251.32.78

### Comprehensive IP Lookup for 142.251.32.78
- **Organization**: Google LLC
- **Network Range**: 142.250.0.0 - 142.251.255.255
- **ASN**: 15169
- **Country**: United States
- **DNS Hostname**: yyz12s07-in-f14.1e100.net.
- **Geolocation**: Toronto, Ontario, Canada
- **Elevation**: ~92 meters above sea level
- **Network Reputation**: The IP has a clean slate in threat databases with no recent negative reports.

### Traffic Analysis Insights
- Conversations were captured using HTTPS over QUIC, noting brain-to-brain interactions with no visible data as it's encrypted.
- Encryption integrity and key exchanges could not be decrypted, a common property in captures without specific decryption keys.

### Scenario Assumptions
1. The capture likely depicts standard browsing or streaming between a home network and Google services.
2. Potential exchanges could include updates fetch or background media stream based on the encrypted data patterns.
