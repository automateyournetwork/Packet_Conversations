# Selector Device S3 Health Report

### Status:
- **Device ID**: S3 
- **Health Status**: Failing
- **Violation**: True (Device is in violation of expected standards)

### Potential Issues:
1. **Interface Traffic Anomalies**:
   - Both incoming and outgoing traffic on the S3 and L121 devices show anomalies.
2. **Operational Status**:
   - Recurring problems with operational status and interface health.
3. **Transceiver/Configuration Issues**:
   - Potential issues linked to the physical transceivers or their configurations (noted as APIC products).
   - Problems might be linked to a batch-related issue due to shared transceiver models and vendors.
4. **Consistent Issues**:
   - Same interfaces consistently involved, pointing towards specific network path-related problems.

### Recommendations:
- Immediate inspection of the physical transceivers and their configurations.
- Check for potential manufacturer batch issues if defects persist across similar models/vendors.
- Analyze the specific network path for persistent issues to better isolate and resolve the underlying problem.
