# March 2025 Packet Capture Analysis Report

## Summary

This report covers the analysis of a packet capture from network traffic recorded on March 15, 2025, specifically focusing on notable IPs and potential security implications.

## General Findings:
- **Total Packets Analyzed**: Multiple packets with varying sizes, up to 1292 bytes.
- **Protocols Identified**: Ethernet, IP, UDP, QUIC, TLS.
- **Observed Traffic**:
  - **QUIC Protocol**: Predominantly used, often with encrypted content. 
  - **TLS Encryption**: Detected, but decryption was not possible due to the lack of TLS secrets.
  - **ETH and IP Analysis**: Captured traffic mainly involved IP `142.251.32.78`.

## IP Address Lookup of `142.251.32.78`:
- **WHOIS Data**:
  - Organization: Google LLC
  - Country: US
  - ASN: AS15169

- **Geolocation Information**:
  - Located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada
  - Latitude: 43.6532, Longitude: -79.3832
  - Elevation: 91.71 meters above sea level.

- **DNS Information**:
  - Hostname: yyz12s07-in-f14.1e100.net.

- **Traceroute Details**:
  - Reachable in two hops (Final Hop: yyz12s07-in-f14.1e100.net)

- **Network Performance**:
  - Average Latency: 78.025 ms
  - Packet Loss: 0%

## Security Implications and Recommendations:
- **Encrypted Traffic**: Given the usage of QUIC and TLS, the traffic is encrypted, indicating potential secure communication likely related to Google services.
- **Monitoring Suggestions**: Continuous monitoring of communication with public IP instances is recommended to detect unauthorized or uncommon activities.
