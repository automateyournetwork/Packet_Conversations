## Security Findings

### 1. Juniper Devices (Critical Priority)
**CVE-2023-44196**
- Severity: MEDIUM (CVSS Score: 6.5)
- Impact: Allows unauthenticated adjacent attacker to impact system integrity
- Affected Versions:
  - 21.3-EVO version 21.3R1-EVO and later
  - 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R3-S4-EVO
- Vulnerability Details:
