- **Fix**: Update to patched versions

### Cisco Devices
**Affected Versions:**
- IOS 17.15 (Catalyst 8000V)
- IOS 21.3R1 (CSR1K/Nexus)

No specific CVEs found for these versions. Regular monitoring and standard security practices recommended.

### Arista Devices
**Affected Versions:**
- EOS 4.26.2F
- EOS 4.28.1F

No specific CVEs found for these versions. Regular monitoring and standard security practices recommended.

## Risk Assessment
1. **Critical Risks:**
   - Multiple DoS vectors exposed through BGP and VXLAN
   - Potential IPsec authentication bypass
   - Network stability risks due to memory leaks

2. **Attack Vectors:**
   - BGP protocol exploitation
   - VXLAN packet processing
   - IPsec authentication bypass
   - Adjacent network attacks

## Remediation Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Schedule emergency maintenance window for Juniper device updates
2. Review and potentially disable BGP traceoptions
3. Audit IPsec configurations using hmac-sha-384/512

### Short-term Actions
1. Implement additional network security controls for BGP sessions
2. Review and update network access controls
3. Validate backup and recovery procedures

### Long-term Actions
1. Establish regular vulnerability assessment schedule
2. Develop automated update procedures
3. Enhance monitoring for security-related events

## Monitoring and Follow-up
1. Implement enhanced monitoring for BGP sessions
2. Regular security scans
3. Vendor security advisory monitoring
4. Regular configuration audits
