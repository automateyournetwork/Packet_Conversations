Based on the data, all of it refers to in the last 30 min, I found that there are a total of 76 devices. Out of these, 66 devices are reported as "healthy," and 10 devices are reported as "failing." This means about 86.8% of the devices are healthy, while 13.2% are failing. It indicates that the majority of devices are operating correctly, but there are some that need attention due to failure status.
