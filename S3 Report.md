Based on the data, the device S3 has a status of "failing" and is currently violating.

I found that the issues might be due to the interface traffic anomalies experienced between devices S3 and L121, specifically on the interface with IP addresses 192.3.121.1/30 and 192.3.121.2/30 respectively. Furthermore, both devices are utilizing the same transceiver model, apic_1, from the vendor APIC, which might have contributed to the problem if there are compatibility issues or defects within the transceiver model itself. Additionally, there are operational status and health anomalies noted on these interfaces, suggesting potential hardware or configuration issues that need addressing.
